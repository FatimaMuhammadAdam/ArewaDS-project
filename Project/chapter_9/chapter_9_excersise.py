#9-1. Restaurant: Make a class called Restaurant. The __init__() method for 
#Restaurant should store two attributes: a restaurant_name and a cuisine_type. 
#Make a method called describe_restaurant() that prints these two pieces of 
#information, and a method called open_restaurant() that prints a message indicating that the restaurant is open.
#Make an instance called restaurant from your class. 
# Print the two attributes individually, and then call both methods.

#9-3. Users: Make a class called User. Create two attributes called first_name
#and last_name, and then create several other attributes that are typically stored 
#in a user profile. Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary 
#of the userâ€™s information. Make another method called greet_user() that prints 
#a personalized greeting to the user.
#Create several instances representing different users, and call both methods for each user.
